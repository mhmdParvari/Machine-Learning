## 1. Surgical
Training a perceptron model on the surgical dataset with different activation functions and observing the loss and accuracy graphs.  
Here is the result for the sigmoid activation function:

## 2. Weather prediction
Fitting another perceptron model (`my_perceptron_v3.py`) on a dataset containing weather temperatures for every hour of the day 
throughout 11 years so that we can predict the average temperature when given the day of the year.
