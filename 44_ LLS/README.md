## Study hours
Training my Linear Least Squares class on the randomly generated dataset of study hours and grades of students and then visualizing the result 
using the cartesian coordinate system I created using OpenCV.  
Then comparing it with linregress from scipy library.  

Blue line --> my LLS  
Green line --> linregress  
Red lines --> bunch of random lines

## Boston houses
Picking 2 features as inputs and 1 feature as target from the BostonHousing dataset, use them to train my LLS and then visualize the result.
